ArduBlu is designed for those who want to control their Arduino projects via Bluetooth connection. Start using by pairing both the Bluetooth module in your project and your phone.

There are many projects in ArduBlu to make things easier for you. You can easily customize and adapt the application to your needs.

ArduBlu provides premium content to the user while it is ad-free. We expect only one thing from you/user, and that is a positive and supportive comment about ArduBlu on the platform where you download it to your device.

<i>Attention: If your phone cannot see the module in the Bluetooth settings, there may be a problem with the module or the android may not support the module. In this case, you cannot control your project with ArduBlu!</i>
